# practical-vim-2nd
Read "Practical Vim, Second Edition" by doing exercises.

This repo is created for learning *usage of vim editor* or *vim operations*.
Before reading this book, I have already written codes with *vim* or *vim plugin on 3rd party editor like sublime text or vscode* for over 10 years.
To level up, I decided to improve my *vim* skills.
I bought 3 books, *Practical Vim, Second Edtion*, *Mastering Vim* and *Modern Vim*.

Here is my reading sequence:
1. *Practical Vim, Second Edition*
2. *Mastering Vim*
3. *Modern Vim*
